**Notes for May 7, 2024**

**Agenda**
- Review last week's notes
- OAuth vs non-OAuth style token exchange - either or both?
  - Andrii - open question what are all the options? existing grant types already have good support, so this is the easy path. But this needs a subject token and this may not be flexible enough
    - Token exchange grant type request is not super flexible, designed around web forms/web browser
    - GNAP may have some work on token exchange to look at
    - Non-oauth mechanisms are complicated, many of the use cases are OAuth centric
  - Yaroslav
    - Agree with Andrii
    - Differences between human/non human use cases include the lack of a web browser, so you can't do http form posts
    - Not everythign maps against OAuth terminology
    - Taking the OAuth token exchange RFC as a foundation of the work makes most sense
    - generalize grant types
  - Dmitry
    - We may need to explain why we're not covering other types of token exchange
    - sees some token exchange mechanissm that are non-oauth
  - Dean
    - If the scope is everyhting (OAuth/non Oauth) the scope may be too large to get work done
    - We'll narrow our focus to OAuth style token exchange and leave others out of scope

  - MISSING NOTES AS I WAS TALKING
  - Yaroslav
    - Use Oauth token exchange but generalize it to non-oauth style tokens
    - Dmitry, Dean agree
  - Dmitry - OAuth to SPIFFE needs a bit better definition
  - look at word doc
  - Andrii - SPIFFE/SPIRE don't use tokens they use certificates for authN not authZ
    - OAuth is usually coarse grained scopes, this does not translate well to fine grained authZ **THIS IS AN OPEN UNSOLVED ISSUE**
  -  Dean
    - RAR / PAR?
  - Andrii - RAR is not well scoped
  - Dean - what do we need to do for interim meeting?
  - Andrii - upsides/downsides of token exchange using the OAuth mechanism
    - upside is use of existing libraries
    - downside doesn't handle non-form data
    - Option is to profile token exchange to handle JWT/COSE inputs as well
    - Andrii will write down a more clear proposal for these ideas
  - Yaroslav - focus on use cases for interim, will polish use cases and put together slides
    -  
  - 
- Writing tasks - @dhs-aws started on rewriting the use cases, can we get the draft set of use cases in IETF language before the interim meeting?
